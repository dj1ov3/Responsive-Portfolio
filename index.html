        Where to begin... well music is and has always been a big player in my life. I could'nt imagine a world without it. The way technology is moving in todays world has changed the way we make and experience music. I'm an Audio Engineer and have been working in that field for about two years now. I'm an up and coming coder/ web designer with ideas to help change the world. My goal is to create software and apps that revolutionize music making as well as help brighten peoples lives and help move humanity in a positive direction thru humanitarian effots and the like. </p>
